<h2>Introduction to Training Module<a href="data-import-from-pdf-sources.html#introduction-to-training-module-14" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Most tutorials for R rely on importing .csv, .xlsx, or .txt files, but there are numerous other file formats that can store data, and these file formats can be more difficult to import into R. PDFs can be particularly difficult to interface with in R because they are not formatted with defined rows/columns/cells as is done in Excel or .csv/.txt formatting. In this module, we will demonstrate how to import data from from PDFs into R and format it such that it is amenable for downstream analyses or export as a table. Familiarity with <em>tidyverse</em>, for loops, and functions will make this module much more approachable, so be sure to review <strong>TAME 2.0 Modules 2.3 Data Manipulation and Reshaping</strong> and <strong>2.4 Improving Coding Efficiencies</strong> if you need a refresher.</p>

<h3>Getting Familiar with the Example Dataset<a href="data-import-from-pdf-sources.html#getting-familiar-with-the-example-dataset" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The following example is based on extracting data from PDFs generated by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), a technique used to quantify the size and distribution of particles in a sample. Each PDF file is associated with one sample, and each PDF contains multiple values that we want to extract. Although this is a very specific type of data, keep in mind that this general approach can be applied to any data stored in PDF format - you will just need to make modifications based on the layout of your PDF file!</p>
<p>For this example, we will be extracting data from 5 PDFs that are identically formatted but contain information unique to each sample. The samples represent particles isolated from epithelial cell media following an experiment where cells were exposed to four different environmental chemicals (labeled “A”, “B”, “C”, and “D”) or a vehicle control (labeled “Ctrl”).</p>
<p>Here is what a full view of one of the PDFs looks like, with values we want to extract highlighted in yellow:
<img src="Module4_3_Input/Module4_3_Image1.png" width="850px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Our goal is to extract these values and end up with a dataframe that looks like this, with each sample in a row and each variable in a column:</p>

<p>If you already have these packages installed, you can skip this step, or you can run the below code which checks installation status for you. We will be using the <em>pdftools</em> and <em>tm</em> packages to extract text from the PDF. And instead of using <code>head()</code> to preview dataframes, we will be using the function <code>datatable()</code> from the <em>DT</em> package. This function produces interactive tables and generates better formatting for viewing dataframes that have long character strings (like the ones we will be viewing in this section).</p>

<h3>Extracting Variables of Interest<a href="data-import-from-pdf-sources.html#extracting-variables-of-interest" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Specific variables of interest can be extracted from the <code>pdf_raw</code> dataframe by filtering the dataframe for rows that contain a specific character string. This character string could be the variable of interest (if that word or set of words is unique and only occurs in that one place in the document) or a character string that occurs in the same line of the PDF as your variable of interest. Examples of both of these approaches are shown below.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there can be different numbers of spaces in each row and after each semicolon, which will change the <code>sep</code> argument for each variable. For example, there are a different number of spaces after the semicolon for “Dilution Factor” than there are for “Concentration” (see above PDF screen shot for reference). We will work through an example for the first variable of interest, dilution factor, in detail.</p>
<p>First, we can see what the dataframe looks like when we just filter rows based on keeping only rows that contain the string “Dilution Factor” in the text column using the <code>grepl()</code> function.</p>

<p>The value we are trying to extract is at the end of a long character string. We will want to use the tidyverse function <code>separate()</code> to isolate those values, but we need to know what part of the character string will separate the dilution factor values from the rest of the text. To determine this, we can call just one of the data cells and copy the semicolon and following spaces for use in the <code>separate()</code> function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb366"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb366-1"><a href="data-import-from-pdf-sources.html#cb366-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Return the value in the first row and second column.</span></span>

<p>Building on top of the previous code, we can now separate the dilution factor value from the rest of the text in the string. The <code>separate()</code> function takes an input data column and separates it into two or more columns based on the character passed to the separation argument. Here, everything before the separation string is discarded by setting the first new column to NA. Everything after the separation string will be stored in a new column called <code>Dilution Factor</code>, The starting <code>Text</code> column is removed by default.</p>

<h2>Importing Data Stored in PDF Tables<a href="data-import-from-pdf-sources.html#importing-data-stored-in-pdf-tables" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The above workflow is useful if you just want to extract a few specific values from PDFs, but isn’t as useful if data are already in a table format in a PDF. The <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/tabulapdf"><em>tabulapdf package</em></a> provides helpful functions for extracting dataframes from tables in PDF format.</p>
<div id="getting-familiar-with-the-example-dataset-1" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3>Getting Familiar with the Example Dataset<a href="data-import-from-pdf-sources.html#getting-familiar-with-the-example-dataset-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The following example is based on extracting dataframes from a long PDF containing many individual data tables. This particular PDF came from the NIH’s BioLINCC Repository and details variables that researchers can request from the repository. Variables are part of larger datasets that contain many variables, with each dataset in a separate table. All of the tables are stored in one PDF file, and some of the tables are longer than one page (this will become relevant later on!). Similar to the first PDF workflow, remember that this is a specific example intended to demonstrate how to work through extracting data from PDFs. Modifications will need to be made for differently formatted PDFs.</p>
<p>Here is what the first three pages of our 75-page starting PDF look like:
<img src="Module4_3_Input/Module4_3_Image3.png" width="850px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>If we zoom in a bit more on the first page, we can see that the dataset name is defined in bold above each table. This formatting is consistent throughout the PDF.
<img src="Module4_3_Input/Module4_3_Image4.png" width="850px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The zoomed in view also allows us to see the columns and their contents more clearly. Some are more informative than others. The columns we are most interested in are listed below along with a description to guide you through the contents.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Num</code>: The number assigned to each variable in the dataset. This numbering restarts with 1 for each table.</li>
<li><code>Variable</code>: The variable name.</li>
<li><code>Type</code>: The type (or class) of the variable, either numeric or character.</li>
<li><code>Label</code>: A description of the variable and values associated with the variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>After extracting the data, we want to end up with a dataframe that contains all of the variables, their corresponding columns, and a column that indicates which dataset the variable is associated with:</p>

<p>The <code>extract_tables()</code> function automatically extracts tables from PDFs and stores them as tibbles (a specific tidyverse data structure similar to a dataframe) within a list. One table is extracted per page, even if the table spans multiple pages. This line of code can take a few seconds to run depending on the length of your PDF.</p>

<p>Notice that, although the dataframe format mirrors the PDF table format, the label column is stored across multiple rows with NAs in the other columns of that row because the text was across multiple lines. In our final dataframe, we will want the entire block of text in one cell. We can also remove the “Len”, “Format”, and “Informat” columns because they are not informative and they are not found in every table. Next, we will walk through how to clean up this table using a series of steps in tidyverse.</p>

<h3>Cleaning dataframes<a href="data-import-from-pdf-sources.html#cleaning-dataframes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>First, we will select the columns we are interested in and use the <code>fill()</code> function to change the NAs in the “Num” column so that each line of text in the “Label” column has the correct “Num” value in the same row.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we need to clean up each dataframe in the list the same way, and we need all of the dataframes to be in one dataframe, instead of in a list. There are a couple of different ways to do this. Both rely on the code shown above for cleaning up each dataframe. Option #1 uses a for loop, while Option #2 uses application of a function on the list of dataframes. Both result in the same ending dataframe!</p>
<p><strong>Option #1</strong></p>

<h3>Adding Dataset Names<a href="data-import-from-pdf-sources.html#adding-dataset-names" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We now have a dataframe with all of the information from the PDFs contained in one long table. However, now we need to add back in the label on top of each table. We can’t do this with the <em>tabulapdf</em> package because the name isn’t stored in the table. But we can use the <em>pdftools</em> package for this!</p>
<p>First, we will read in the pdf using the PDF tools package. This results in a vector containing a long character string for each page of the PDF. Notice a few features of these character strings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each line is separated by <code>\n</code></li>
<li>Elements [1] and [2] of the vector contain the text “dataset Name:”, while element [3] does not because the third page was a continuation of the table from the second page and therefore did not have a table title.</li>

<p>Now that we have the dataset name stored as a variable, we can create a dataframe that will correspond to the rows in our <code>variables</code> dataframe. The challenge is that each dataset contains a different number of variables! We can determine how many rows each dataset contains by returning to our <code>variables</code> dataframe and calculating the number of rows associated with each dataset. The following code splits the <code>variables</code> dataframe into a list of dataframes by each occurrence of 1 in the “Num” column (when the numbering restarts for a new dataset).</p>

<p>The number of rows in each list is the number of variables in that dataset. We can use this value in creating our dataframe of dataset names.</p>
